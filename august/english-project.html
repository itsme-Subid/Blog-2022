            </p>
            <p dir="auto"><strong>Me:</strong> Welcome! can you please introduce yourself?</p>
            <p dir="auto"><strong>Torvalds:</strong> Thanks! I'm Linus Torvalds, the creator of the Linux kernel. I'm
                also the principal developer of the Git version control system.</p>
            <p dir="auto"><strong>Me:</strong> What made you decide to start programming?</p>
            <p dir="auto"><strong>Torvalds:</strong> I was always interested in computers and how they worked, and I
                wanted to know more about how to make them work better. In high school, I started taking programming and
                computer science classes, and I really enjoyed it. I also started reading a lot about programming and
                software development, and I realized that this was something I really wanted to do.</p>
            <p dir="auto"><strong>Me:</strong> What were your early experiences with programming like?</p>
            <p dir="auto"><strong>Torvalds:</strong> I started out by programming in BASIC on my home computer, and I
                loved it. I also started tinkering with the source code for the operating system that my computer ran,
                and I learned a lot about how to make changes and improve it. I was really hooked on programming from
                then on.</p>
            <p dir="auto"><strong>Me:</strong> What are your thoughts on the role of programming in the modern world?
            </p>
            <p dir="auto"><strong>Torvalds:</strong> I think programming is essential to the modern world. We rely on
                software, from running our businesses to communicating with friends and family. Without programmers, the
                world would be a very different place.</p>
            <p dir="auto"><strong>Me:</strong> What are your thoughts on this many Linux Distros?</p>
            <p dir="auto"><strong>Torvalds:</strong> I actually don't use that many different distributions these days.
                I used to use a lot more, but these days I've pretty much settled on just a few. I've got Mint on my
                laptop, and I've been using it for years now. I've also got Ubuntu on my desktop, and I've been using
                that for almost as long. I used to use Debian a lot, but I've found that Ubuntu is just a bit more
                up-to-date and easier to use for me. I also have a few virtual machines that I use for testing purposes,
                and I tend to use Fedora or openSUSE on those. But to be honest, I don't really use that many different
                distributions anymore. I'm pretty happy with the ones I've got.</p>
            <p dir="auto"><strong>Me:</strong> What are your thoughts on C/C++ role in Linux kernel development?</p>
            <p dir="auto"><strong>Torvalds:</strong> C/C++ has been absolutely essential for the development of the
                Linux kernel. The kernel is a very complex piece of software, and it simply would not be possible to
                develop it without using a powerful programming language like C/C++. The Linux kernel is also a very
                large project, and it is constantly evolving. C/C++ allows us to add new features and functionality to
                the kernel very quickly, and it is also very easy to find and fix bugs in the kernel using C/C++.</p>
            <p dir="auto"><strong>Me:</strong> What are your thoughts on modern programming languages like python in
                Linux kernel development?</p>
            <p dir="auto"><strong>Torvalds:</strong> I wouldn't say that I'm particularly enamoured of any of the newer
                languages. I think they're all interesting, and I can see the appeal of some of them (particularly
                Python), but at the same time, I don't see any of them as being particularly well-suited for kernel
                development. Part of it is just that the Linux kernel is a very large project, and it has a lot of
                existing code that is written in C. So any new language would have to be able to interface well with C
                code, and that's not always easy. But I think the bigger issue is that the Linux kernel is a very
                complex system, and I don't think any of the newer languages are really designed for dealing with that
                level of complexity. They're more geared towards smaller programs. So, while I think it's interesting to
                experiment with new languages, I don't see any of them as being a good fit for the kernel.</p>
            <p dir="auto"><strong>Me:</strong> How did you come to develop the Linux kernel?</p>
            <p dir="auto"><strong>Torvalds:</strong> I was a student at the University of Helsinki, and I was using a
                minicomputer called the MINIX operating system. I was also reading about the Unix operating system, and
                I was fascinated by it. I wanted to create my own version of Unix, and so I started developing the Linux
                kernel.</p>
            <p dir="auto"><strong>Me:</strong> How has Linux developed over the years?</p>
            <p dir="auto"><strong>Torvalds:</strong> When I first started developing Linux, it was just a hobby project.
                I never expected it to become as popular as it is today. Over the years, more and more people have
                started using and contributing to Linux. Today, Linux is used by millions of people around the world,
                and it is powering some of the biggest websites and servers like Cloudflare, Azure, etc.</p>
            <p dir="auto"><strong>Me:</strong> What are your future plans for Linux?</p>
            <p dir="auto"><strong>Torvalds:</strong> My goal is to keep Linux development going. I want to keep
                improving Linux and making it better. I also want to continue working on other open-source projects.</p>
            <p dir="auto"><strong>Me:</strong> What are your thoughts on Indian software development market?</p>
            <p dir="auto"><strong>Torvalds:</strong> The Indian software development market is quite interesting. On the
                one hand, there are a lot of very talented developers in India. On the other hand, the vast majority of
                them are working in the outsourcing industry, which often means that they are not working on the most
                innovative or interesting projects. There are definitely some interesting start-ups and projects coming
                out of India, but it's still a relatively small part of the overall market. I think it has a lot of
                potentials, but it will take some time for the country to really start producing world-class software on
                a large scale.</p>
            <p dir="auto"><strong>Me:</strong> Lastly, what are your thoughts on how to start coding in Linux?</p>
            <p dir="auto"><strong>Torvalds:</strong> There's really no one answer to that question since it depends on
                your level of coding expertise and where you want to start coding in Linux. However, a good starting
                point for most people would be to find a project that you're interested in working on and then find a
                way to contribute to that project. If you're not sure where to start, a good place to look for projects
                is GitHub - there are many open-source projects hosted there, and many of them are looking for
                contributions from new developers. Once you've found a project that you want to contribute to, take a
                look at their documentation to see how to get started. If you're already familiar with coding in Linux,
                and you just want to find a project to work on, a good place to start is with the Linux kernel. The
                kernel is the core of the Linux operating system, and it's always in need of new features and bug fixes.
                You can find out more about how to get involved with the kernel development process here.</p>
